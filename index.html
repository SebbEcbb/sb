            Striving to live from the heart <br><br></span>
        <strong>Descendant of Reuben,<br>
            firstborn of Jacob ... <br> ... and his cousin.</strong></p>
        <p><br>
            A cold winter day in <b>January 1971,</b> 
            late at night. 24 hours of hard labor. 
            A boy was born in France, 
            near Saint-Etienne.
        </p>
        <p>French father and Dutch mother. </p>
        <p>           
            They divorced a year later. 
            Cultural miscomprehension. 
            The boy grew up with mum in the Netherlands.
            They moved about 12 times in 25 years.
            That number would still multiply.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>The Netherlands, his foundation.</h4>
        <p>
            Tough. Street jungle education. 
            At least for this little man.
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Good at maths, sports and music. 
            But never learned to how work hard. 
            Football was more pleasant. And he was good at it. 
            8 years old, playing with Martin Jol. Still proud of it. 
            He could have become a pro, if he had stayed around.
            But mummy moved on. He lost all contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she wanted him to start piano. 11 years old. 
            Mum was determined. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But he was a stranger in the grey lowlands.
            He didn't really fit in anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            A girlfriend and her loving parents helped him to get 
            his high school degree. 
            Quite a  miracle, seen the circumstances.
            After working in a bank for a year, 
            he managed to enter a High School for Arts in Utrecht with piano. 
            His mother bought him a new piano. Exceptional sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kind of studied for four years. 
            Gifted, but it was hard to focus on things.
            Too much going inside. He also had problems with relations.
            Abd he was interested in so many other things.
            A lot of time he was trying to make his own music, 
            probably in need of his identity.
            And then he improvised.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also busy with philosophical questions. Stoned, most of the time.
            Things like Torah, I-Tjing, Tarot, Freud and Carl Jung 
            became very interesting, under influence of good Dutch marihuana. Lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding absolutely nothing, 
            he spent a lot of time on meditation and writing. 
            Or spacing out, if you prefer. 
            The rest of his time, he improvised on his fine piano.<br><br>

            For a time, he argued weekly with an elder of the Jehovah's 
            witnesses. About God and the reasons of life. 
            To provoke and test the poor old man, who said he knew God.
            But also out of curiosity. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            He'd had some very extra-ordinary experiences. 
            Those were the reason behind all the chaos. Mystisicm.
            It'd stirred up great curiosity and started a path of wondering. 
            He had seen things and was sure there were hidden truths.
        </p>
        <p>    
            But go and work? Nah,...not for him. Not now.
            He was contemplating!
        </p>
        <p>
            Entire days he would try to compose music, sometimes for 15 hours. 
            But he could not get devoted to practising his parts for Art School. 
            Too boring. And his mind was so busy with all thoses very interesting things.           
        </p>
        <p>
            His complicated mind made social life very difficult.
            Relationships broke, for lack of compatibility.
            In his need for stability, he was all over the place. 
            And changing all the time. Hard for people to bear with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            So he found himself alone again at 24, 
            living on a boat. ABRAXAS, centre of Amsterdam. Still there. 
            The rent was 3 times his monthly income as a student. 
            With his piano, he had found no better solution: live on a boat.            
            What the heck kept him going ?
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it generated stress. Broken relationships, 
            failed studies, lack of money, daily smoking marihuana, 
            being around the wrong people.
            His mental state made it impossible to concentrate on anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            He did one good thing: play piano in the Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, 
            mainly on business meals and conferences. 
            He always improvised. They liked it and paid well.
            But occasions were little.            
        </p>
        <p>
            He had stopped smoking. Another good thing.
            It was maybe his first real prayer. 
            "Take this shit away from me, it kills me!"
            It was true, it had. And the prayer was also true. It had worked. 
            He never touched it again.            
        </p>
        <p>            
            Poor, needy and unable to integrate in any structure, 
            he was floating, not only on his boat. In his mind and spirit.
            Then out of the blue, his grand-mother popped up in Amsterdam,
            with her little Ford Focus. 
            "You come with me !", she said. She was determined. No choice.
            She had taken care of everything: the boat, the piano, stuff around.
            How the heck did she know about his state ?
            Maybe that prayer had done a bit more than he expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            He spent 10 month with her, trying to make sense out of his life.
            Walking, running, for hours, every day, pondering.             
            He still had no idea what his life was meant to be.
            It came to the point where he felt Holland was not his homeland anymore. 
            He got a new idea: "leave Holland, got to France." 
            At 25, he left for good. A first life ended.
        </p>
        <h4>Second chance: France</h4>
        <p>
            His birth country. <br>
            A new start?
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Living with his father, he tried to be accepted at the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon for a composer's study. 
            Another bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months and produced 6 pieces of music. 
            He was satisfied with his work.
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            The 3 or 4 spots were already taken before he even applied. He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was disappointed. But at least he'd finished something. 
            It had inspired him. Music friends liked his piano pieces.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with anyone, the relationship with his father was difficult. 
            They were friends, but both strong heads. Not very suitable to live together. 
            He had to go anyway… find his life. 
            He left his father after the unpleasant school experience
            and went to visit a friend in Bordeaux.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there he met a community. Believers. People,
            living on a farm in the South of France. Back then, that was still possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their life was impressive to him. Lots of people. Hard workers.
            He liked it. There was a certain peace : something he had been missing in his life.
            He stayd 3 months and many things happened.  
            He ended up being a believer himself and returned 
            a year later.
            He wanted to know God and love.
            And he wanted work hard.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Farm-life had a lot going on: 
            Business and many kinds of projects.
            They worked hard, 6 days a week, with friends, often for 20 hours a day.
            He enjoyed being with people and learning to work.
            Farming, gardening, baking, construction,
            mechanics, wood works, animals, and more. 
            He also learned a lot about social matters. 
            Relationships, communication, collectivity, team-work, and more.
        
        <p>
            After a few years, he started to do the bookkeeping, on request of others.
            There was a need in that domain.
            He loved it and end up doing it for over 10 years. 
            He learned, working closely with the professional accountants. 
            He also learned some programming skills and web development.
            At social events he played piano with other musicians.
        </p>   

        <p>
            In the strength of his life, with love and zeal for his newfound 
            occupations, he had become a pretty zealous and motivated person. 
            Ready to do a lot for the people he loved.
            He had finally found a reason to be wholehearted and have self-respect. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            After eight years, he got married. They raised four 
            children. Not without trouble, but usually they were happy.             
        </p>
        <p>
            10 years of married life passed, relatively peaceful.
            Compared to what was about to come. 
            Some serious problems arose, especially for his family.    
            <br><br> 
            As everything works out for the good, to those 
            who don't resist the flow of life, as painful as it can be,
            the years following exposed some deeply disappointing facts.
            And everything changed again. For good.
        </p>            
        <p>
            A third life started .... again with music.
        </p>
        <br>
              
        <p><strong>TO BE CONTINUED.....maybe!</strong></p>
