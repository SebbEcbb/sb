            <span style="text-align:left; color:red; font-weight:bold; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:2px;">
            Striving to live from the heart <br><br></span>
        <strong>Descendant of Reuben,<br>
            firstborn of Jacob ... <br> ... and his cousin.</strong></p>
        <p><br>
            A cold winter day in <b>January 1971,</b> 
            late at night. 24 hours of hard labor. <br>
            A boy was born in France, 
            near Saint-Etienne.
        </p>
        <p>French father and Dutch mother. </p>
        <p>           
            They divorced a year later. 
            Cultural miscomprehension. 
            The boy grew up with mum in the Netherlands.
            He moved about 12 times in 25 years.
            That number would still multiply.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>The Netherlands, his foundation.</h4>
        <p>
            Tough. Street jungle education. 
            At least for this little man.
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Good at maths, sports and music. 
            But never learned to work hard. 
            Football was more pleasant. And he was good too. 
            At 8 years old he played with Martin Jol. Still proud. 
            He could have become pro, if he had stayed around.
            But mum moved on. He lost all contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she wanted him to start piano. 11 years old. 
            Mum was determined. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But he felt stranger in the grey lowlands.
            Didn't fit in anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            A gentle girlfriend and her loving parents helped him to get 
            a high school degree. 
            Quite a  miracle, seen the circumstances.
            After working in a bank for a year, 
            he managed to enter a High School for Arts in Utrecht with piano. 
            His mother bought him a new piano. Exceptional sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kind of studied for four years. 
            Gifted, but it was hard to focus on things.
            Too much going on inside. He also had problems with relations.
            Interested in too many other things.
            A lot of his time he was trying to make his own music, 
            probably in need of an identity.
            He started to improvise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Busy with philosophical matters, stoned, most of the time, 
            he read books like
            Torah, I-Tjing, Tarot, Carl Jung and the like.
            It became very interesting, under influence of good Dutch marihuana. Lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding absolutely nothing of it all, 
            he was still eager to find answers to his pains.
            He spent a lot of time thinking, or spacing out, if you prefer.
            He wrote down piles of ideas. Some very interesting.
            To sooth his condition, he played piano. Always improvised.<br><br>

        </p>
        <p> 
            He'd had some extra-ordinary experiences, 
            opening an interest to mystisicm.
            It'd stirred up curiosity and started a path of wondering. 
            He was sure there were hidden truths.
        </p>
        <p>    
            But go and work? Nah,...not for him. Not now.
            He was contemplating!
        </p>
        <p>
            Entire days he would try to compose music, sometimes for 15 hours. 
            But he could not get devoted to practising his parts for Art School. 
            Too boring. And his mind was so busy.
        </p>
        <p>
            It made social life very difficult.
            Relationships broke.            
        
            So he found himself alone at 24, 
            living on a boat. ABRAXAS, centre of Amsterdam. 
            It's still there today. 
            The rent was 3 times what he could affort.
            But with his piano, he had found no better solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it generated stress. Broken relationships, 
            failed studies, lack of money, addictions,
            being around the wrong people.            
        </p>
        <p>
            He did one good thing: play piano in the Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, 
            for specila nights, business meals and conferences. 
            He always improvised. The people liked it and paid pretty well.
            But occasions were little.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he stopped smoking. Another good thing.
            It was maybe his first real prayer. 
            "Take this shit away from me, it kills me!"
            It was true, it had. And the prayer was also true. It had worked. 
            He never touched it again.            
        </p>
        <p>            
            Poor, needy and unable to integrate in any structure, 
            he was floating, not only on his boat. In his mind and spirit.
            Then out of the blue, his grand-mother popped up in Amsterdam,
            with her little Ford Focus. 
            "You come with me !", she said. She was determined. No choice.
            She had taken care of everything: the boat, the piano, stuff around.
            How the heck did she know about his state ?
            Maybe that prayer had done a bit more than he expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            He spent 10 month with her, trying to make sense out of his life.
            Walking, running, for hours, every day, pondering.             
            He still had no idea what his life was meant to be.
            It came to the point where he felt Holland was not his homeland anymore. 
            He got an idea: "leave Holland, try France." 
            At 25, he left. First with his father near Lyon.
            A life in the Netherlands had ended, probably for good.
        </p>
        <h4>Second chance: France</h4>
        <p>
            His birth country. <br>
            A new start? He was happy there. Felt better. 
            His father had a rich social life. New opportunities opened up.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Living with his father, he tried to be accepted at the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon for a composer's study. 
            Another bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months and produced 6 pieces of music. 
            He was satisfied with his work.
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            The 3 or 4 spots were already taken before he even applied. He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was disappointed. But at least he'd finished something. 
            It had inspired him. Music friends liked his piano pieces.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with anyone, the relationship with his father was difficult. 
            They were friends, but not very suitable to live together. 
            He had to go … find his life. 
            He left his father went to visit a friend in Bordeaux.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there he met a community. People
            living on a farm in the South of France. 
            Believers in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their life was impressive to him. Lots of people. Hard workers.
            He liked it. There was structure and peace : things he had been missing so far.
            He stayd 3 months the first time, but ended up being a believer himself.
            He returned a year later to stay.
            He was now determined to discover God, love others and work hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farm-life had a lot going on: 
            business and projects.
            They worked 6 days a week, always together with friends. 
            Often for 18 hours a day.
            He enjoyed being with people and learned a lot.
            Farming, baking, some construction,
            some mechanics, wood works, animals, normal things in life. 
            He also learned about relationships and what makes them nice:  
            Communication, being together with patience and kindness ...
            And they played music every day, with singing and dancing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He had become a pretty zealous and motivated person. 
            Ready to do a lot for people he loved.
            He had found a reason to be wholehearted and have some self-respect. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            After eight years, he got married. They raised four 
            children. Usually everybody happy.                   
            Thus 10 years passed by, relatively peaceful.            
            <br><br> 
            Until new problems arose, especially for his family.
            Painful as it was, it exposed deeply disappointing facts.
            And everything changed again.
        </p>            
        <p>
            A third life started .... again with music.
        </p>
        <br>
              
        <p><strong>TO BE CONTINUED.....maybe!</strong></p>
