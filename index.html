        <h3 style="margin-block-end: 0;">The story of A man</h3>
        <p><strong>A descendant of Reuben,<br>
            first born of Jacob.</strong></p>
        <p>
            On a cold winterday in <b>January of 1971,</b> 
            late at night, after 24 hours of hard labor, 
            a little boy was born in France, 
            near Saint-Etienne.
        </p>    
        <p> French father and a courageous Dutch mother. </p>
        <p>           
            Unfortunately, they divorced a year later. 
            Cultural miscomprehension. 
            The boy grew up with his mother in the Netherlands.
            Living in various places, he moved about 12 times in 25 years.
            The tendency would only increase over the next 25.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Foundation: The Netherlands</h4>
        <p>
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Good at maths, sports and music. 
            As a child, he never learned to work hard. Football was nicer. And he was good at it too. 
            As child he played with Martin Jol. Still proud of it.
            He started piano at 11. He mother wanted him to. <br>
            But childhood was tough as a stranger in the grey Netherlands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saved by his girlfriend and her loving parents, 
            he got a high school degree. Ouaow!
            After working in a bank for one year, 
            he managed to be accepted at the High School for Arts in Utrecht. 
            His mother bought him an exceptional piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            He studied classical piano for four years. 
            Gifted, but it was hard for him to focus on anything.
            He had family problems and was interested in too many other things.
            He also spent a lot of time trying to make his own music, 
            in need of finding his identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occupied with philosophical questions, he read a lot. Stoned, most of the time.
            Books like the Torah, the I-Tjing, Freud and Carl Jung 
            became very interesting, under influence of good Dutch marihuana. Lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            In such a state, understanding absolutely nothing of what he read, 
            he spent a lot of time on meditation and writing. 
            Or spacing out, if you prefer. <br><br>
            He argued for two years, almost every week with an elder of the Jehovah's 
            witnesses about God and the reasons of life. 
            To provoke and test the poor old man, who said he knew God.
            But also out of curiosity. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            He'd had some very extra-ordinary convincing experiences.
            It'd stirred up great curiosity and started a spiritual process. 
            He was sure he had to discover something hidden.
        </p>
        <p>    
            But going to work? nah,...not for him. 
            He was thinking!
        </p>
        <p>
            Entire days he would try to compose music, sometimes for 15 hours. 
            But he could not get devoted to practising his parts for Art School. 
            His mind was too busy.           
        </p>
        <p>
            His complicated lifestyle made any social life very difficult.
            Relationships broke, for lack of stability and maturity.
            His creative mind went all over the place, and it was hard for others to bear 
            up with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several failing love relationships, he found himself alone again at 24, 
            living on a boat in the centre of Amsterdam. 
            The rent was 3 times his monthly budget, available as a student. 
            He had found no better solution than live on a boat, with his piano,
            15 hours a day. Income : 450 p/m, rent 1100 p/m. 
            What the heck kept him going?
        </p>
        <p>
            All this generated stress. The broken relationships, 
            studies that had suffered lack of concentration, 
            lack of money, daily smoking marihuana, 
            and other stuff, like wrong relationships.
            His mental state made it even harder to concentrate on anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            He did one good thing: play piano in the Amsterdam Marriott Hotel. 
            He always improvised. They liked it and paid him well.
            But the occasions were too little.
            He struggled to stop smoking and get life going.
        </p>
        <p>
            He went through some kind of identity crisis. 
            Needy and unable to integrate in any structure.
            Even to the point that he felt Holland was not his home land anymore. 
            Then he got an idea: "leave Holland,try France."" 
            He left for good.At 25, a first life ended.
        </p>
        <h4>Second chance: France</h4>
        <p>
            His birth country. <br>
            Start again from zero?
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Living with his father, he tried to be accepted at the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon for a composer's study. 
            Bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months and produced 6 pieces of music. 
            He was satisfied with his work.
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            The 3 or 4 spots were already taken. He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was disappointed. But at least he'd finished something. 
            It had inspired him. Music friends liked his piano pieces.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with anyone, the relationship with his father was difficult. 
            They were friends, but both strong heads. Not very suitable to live together. 
            He had to go anyway… find his life. 
            He left his father after the unpleasant school experience
            and went to visit a friend in Bordeaux.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there he met a community. Believers. People,
            living on a farm in the South of France. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Their life was impressive to him. Lots of people. Hard workers.
            He liked it. There was a certain peace : something he had been missing in his life.
            He stayd 3 months and many things happened.  
            He ended up being a believer himself and returned 
            a year later.
            He wanted to know God and love.
            And he wanted work hard.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Farm-life had a lot going on: 
            farming, business and projects.
            They worked hard, 6 days a week, with friends, often for 20 hours a day.
            He enjoyed being with people and learning to work.
            Farming, gardening, baking, construction,
            mechanics, wood works, animals, and more. 
            He also learned a lot about social matters. 
            Relationships, communication, collectivity, team-work, and more.
        
        <p>
            After a few years, he started to do the bookkeeping, on request of others.
            There was a need in that domain.
            He loved it and end up doing it for over 10 years. 
            He learned, working closely with the professional accountants. 
            He also did some programming skills and web development.
            At the social events he still played piano, with other musicians.
        </p>   

        <p>
            In the strength of his life, with love and zeal for his newfound 
            occupations, he had become a pretty zealous and motivated person. 
            Ready to do a lot for the people he loved.
            He had finally found a reason to be wholehearted and have self-respect. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            After eight years, he got married. They raised four 
            children. Not without trouble, but usually they were happy.             
        </p>
        <p>
            10 years of married life passed, relatively peaceful.
            Compared to what was ahead. 
            Some serious problems arose for his family.    
             
            As everything works out for the good to those 
            who do not resist life's flow, and as painful as it can be,
            the years following exposed some deeply disappointing facts.
            And everything changed again. For good.
        </p>            
        <p>
            A third life started .... again with music.
