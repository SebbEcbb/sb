        <h3 style="margin-block-end: 0;">A story of A man</h3>
        <p><strong>Descendant of Reuben</strong></p>
        <p>
            On the 8th of January, 1971, a little boy was born in France,
            near Saint-Etienne. French father and Dutch mother. 
            They divorced a year later. He grew up with mum, in the Netherlands.
            They lived in various places. He moved 12 times in his first 25 years.
            A pattern that would only increase over the years.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>First life: The Netherlands</h4>
        <p>
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Good at maths, sports and music. 
            As child, he never learned to work hard. Preferred playing football. 
            He started to learn piano at age 11.
        </p>

        <p>
            With help from his girlfriend and her loving parents, 
            he got his high school degree. 
            After working in a bank for one year, 
            he managed to be accepted at the High School for Arts in Utrecht. 
            His mother bought him an exceptional piano.
            His piano teacher prepared him wholeheartedly.
        </p>

        <p>
            He studied classical piano for four years. 
            Gifted, but it was hard for him to focus on anything.
            He had family problems and was interested in too many other things.
            He also spent a lot of time trying to make his own music, 
            by need of finding his identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occupied with philosophical questions, he read a lot. Stoned, most of the time.
            Books like the Torah, the I-Tjing (Yin & Yang), Freud and Carl Jung 
            became very interesting, under influence of good Dutch marihuana. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In that state, understanding absolutely nothing of what he read, 
            he also spent a lot of time on meditation and writing. 
            Or spacing out, if you prefer.
            He argued for two years, almost every week with an elder of the Jehovah's 
            witnesses about God and the reasons of life. To provoke and test.
            But also out of curiosity. He'd had some very mysterious experiences.
            That had stirred curiosity and started his research. 
            He was sure he had to discover something.
        </p>
        <p>    
            But going to work? noouh,...not for him. He was thinking!
        </p>

        <p>
            Entire days he would try to compose music, sometimes for 15 hours. 
            But he could not get devoted to practise his parts for Art School. 
            His mind was too busy.           
        </p>

        <p>
            His complicated lifestyle made any social life very difficult.
            Relationships broke, for lack of stability and maturity.
            His creative mind went all over the place, and it was hard for others to bear 
            up with him.
        </p>

        <p>
            After different failing relationships, he found himself alone again at 24, 
            living on a boat in the centre of Amsterdam. 
            The rent was 3 times his monthly budget, available as student. 
            He had found no better solution than to go live on a boat with his piano playing,
            15 hours a day. Income : 450 p/m, rent 1100 p/m. 
            What the heck kept him going?
        </p>

        <p>
            All this generated stress. The broken relationships, 
            studies that had suffered lack of concentration, 
            lack of money, daily smoking marihuana, 
            and other stuff, like wrong relationships.
            His mental state made it even harder to concentrate on anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            He did one good thing: play piano in the Amsterdam Marriott Hotel. 
            He always improvised. They liked it and paid him well.
            But the occasions were too little.
            He struggled to stop smoking and get life going.
        </p>

        <p>
            Needy, he went through some kind of identity crisis. 
            Felt unable to integrate in any structure.
            Even to the point that he felt Holland was not his home anymore. 
            Then he made up his mind: leave and try France. He left for good. 
            At 25, a first life ended.
        </p>

        <h4>Second life: France</h4>
        <p>
            His birth country. A second chance?
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Living with his father, he tried to be accepted at the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon for a composer's education. 
            Bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months and produced 6 pieces music. 
            He was satisfied about the result.
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            Places were already taken. He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was happy with his work, though. At least he'd finished something. 
            It had inspired him. Friends liked it.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like usually, the relationship with his father was difficult. 
            They were friends, but both strong heads. Unable to live together. 
            He had to go anyway… find his life. 
            He left his father after 6 months and started to travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            His first stop was going to be a Christian community, 
            living on a farm in the South of France. On Corsica, he'd met a friend, 
            who had spent four days there. His story was convincing enough 
            to go and visit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The life on the farm was impressive. 
            He ended up being a believer and stayed.
            He wanted to love and serve others. And work hard.
            This hasn't changed ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            The farm had a lot going on. 
            Farm-life, businesses and projects.
            Working hard, 6 days per week, with friends, often for 20 hours a day,
            he enjoyed being with others. He learned many skills.
            Farming, gardening, caring for animals, baking, construction jobs,
            mechanics, wood works and more. 
        
        <p>
            Then he started to do their bookkeeping, on their request. There was a need.
            He loved it and did for over 10 years. 
            He learned everything, working closely with their accountants. 
            He also learned programming languages and web development.
            At social occasions he still played piano, with other musicians.
            
        </p>   

        <p>
            He had become a very zealous and motivated person. 
            In the strength of his life,
            with love for his newfound identity, he finally had a reason to 
            be wholehearted and have some self-respect. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After eight years, he got married. They raised four children. 
            Not without problems, but happy.             
        </p>
        <p>
            18 years passed peacefully. They had challenges, 
            but he was very fulfilled.
            Then times changed.
        </p>
