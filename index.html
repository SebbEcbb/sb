            Striving to live from the heart <br><br></span>
        <strong>Descendant of Reuben,<br>
            firstborn of Jacob ... and his cousin.</strong></p>
        <p><br>
            A cold winter day in <b>January 1971,</b> 
            late at night, after 24 hours of hard labor,
            a boy was born in France, 
            near Saint-Etienne.
        </p>
        <p>
            French father, Dutch mother. They divorced a year later. 
            Cultural miscomprehension.
        </p>        
        <p>               
            The boy grew up with mum in Holland. They moved about 12 times in 20 years.
            That number would only multiply.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>The Netherlands, his foundation.</h4>
        <p>
            Tough. Street jungle education. 
            At least for this little man.
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Pretty good at maths, sports and music, but never learned to work hard. 
            Football was better. And he was good too. 
            At 8 years old he played with Martin Jol. Still proud. 
            He could have become pro, if he had stayed in the right place.
            But mum moved on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she wanted him to play piano. 11 years old. 
            Mum was determined. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He felt stranger in the grey lowlands.
            Didn't fit anywhere. Schooltime was terrible.
            Peers were jealous at his football playing and his summer/winter holidays in France.
            They called him French cheesehead. It had lead to many years of trouble.
            Mum didn't realize.
        </p>
        <p>
            A nice girlfriend with loving parents helped him to get 
            a high school degree. 
            A miracle, seen the circumstances.
            After working in a bank for a year, 
            he managed to enter the High School for Arts in Utrecht. 
            Mum bought him a nice piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kind of studied for four years, maybe gifted, but certainly undisciplined. 
            Unable yet to focus, having too much going on inside.
            He was strongly drawn to develop his own music.                    
        </p>    
        <p>
            Entire days, sometimes 15 hours non-stop, he would search, try and write down music parts. 
            But he could not get devoted to practice his parts for Art School. 
            Something was missing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social life was difficult and relationships broke.     
            At 24, he found himself alone,
            living on a boat, ABRAXAS, in the center of Amsterdam.
            The rent was 3 times his budget.
            For his piano, no better solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            It generated stress. For a while, he played in the Amsterdam Marriott Hotel, 
            for special occasions, usually improvising. People liked it and it paid well.
            But the occasions were little.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he stopped smoking. Maybe his first real prayer. 
            "Take the shit away from me, it kills me!"
            It was true, it had. And the prayer was also true. It had worked. 
            He never touched it again.            
        </p>
        <p>            
            Poor, needy and unable to integrate in a structure, 
            he was floating around, not only on his boat. In his mind and spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until all of a sudden, out of the blue, his grand-mother popped up in Amsterdam,
            with a little Ford Focus. <br>
            <b>"Come with me !"</b>, she said. She was determined and left him no choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had taken care of everything: the boat, the piano, stuff around.
            How the heck did she know about it all ?
            Maybe that prayer had done a bit more than he expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            He spent 10 month with her. Walking, running, for hours, every day. Pondering.
            Trying to make sense out of his life, and get some work.            
            He had no idea what his life was meant to be anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he decided to leave Holland and go to France.
            Bearly 25, in january 1996, he went to his father near Lyon.
            A life in the Netherlands had ended, probably for good.
        </p>
        <h4>Second chance: France</h4>
        <p>
            What did he find in his birth country ? <br>
            A new start ? He was happy and felt better. He was accepted and fit in somehow.
            Definitely more than in Holand.
            His father had a rich social life. New opportunities opened up.        
        </p>
        <p>
            He first tried to be enter the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon, for a composer's study. 
            Bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months and produced 6 pieces of music. 
            He was satisfied with his work. People liked it.
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            The few spots had already been appointed before he even applied. 
            He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was disappointed. But at least he'd finished something. 
            It had inspired him.
            <br>        
            So he had to go on … find his life. 
            He left his father went to visit a friend in Bordeaux.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there he met a community. People
            living on a farm in the South of France. 
            Believers in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their life was impressive to him. Lots of people. Hard workers.
            He liked it. There was structure and peace : things he had been missing so far.
            He stayd 3 months the first time, but ended up being a believer himself.
            He returned a year later to stay.
            He was now determined to discover God, love others and work hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farm-life had a lot going on: 
            business and projects.
            They worked 6 days a week, always together with friends. 
            Often for 18 hours a day.
            He enjoyed being with people and learned a lot.
            Farming, baking, some construction,
            some mechanics, wood works, animals, normal things in life. 
            He also learned about relationships and what makes them nice:  
            Communication, being together with patience and kindness ...
            And they played music every day, with singing and dancing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He had become a pretty zealous and motivated person. 
            Ready to do a lot for people he loved.
            He had found a reason to be wholehearted and have some self-respect. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            After eight years, he got married. They raised four 
            children. Usually everybody happy.                   
            Thus 10 years passed by, relatively peaceful.            
            <br><br> 
            Until new problems arose, especially for his family.
            Painful as it was, it exposed deeply disappointing facts.
            And everything changed again.
        </p>            
        <p>
            A third life started .... again with music.
        </p>
        <br>
              
        <p><strong>TO BE CONTINUED.....maybe!</strong></p>
