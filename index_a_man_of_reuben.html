        <h3 style="margin-block-end: 0;">A story of A man</h3>
        <p><strong>Descendant of Reuben</strong></p>
        <p>
            On the 8th of January, 1971, a little boy was born in France,
            near Saint-Etienne. French father and Dutch mother. 
            They divorced a year later. He grew up with mum, in the Netherlands.
            They lived in various places. 12 to be exact.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>First life: The Netherlands</h4>
        <p>
            A happy boy, somewhat tender and gentle, certainly full of energy.  
            Good at maths, sports and music. 
            Never learned to work hard. Preferred playing. 
            First wrong choice. <br><br>
            He ended up leaving his mother at 17. Lots of hidden stories. Difficult relationship.
            It could have been worse. 
            It was the result of a child left to his own desires in a hard and 
            selfish world. 
            And of course, often drawn to the wrong people.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Saved by his girlfriend and her loving parents, 
            he got his high school degree. 
            After working in a bank for one year, getting bored, 
            he somehow managed to be accepted at the High School for Arts in Utrecht. 
            This time with help from his mother, who bought him an exceptional piano, 
            and his piano teacher, who prepared him wholeheartedly.
        </p>

        <p>
            He studied classical piano for four years. At least he tried.
            He wasn't really worthy of all the investments. 
            As usual, he wasn't motivated. Other exciting things were more attractive. 
            Composing, marijuana, I-Tjing(Yin & Yang), Tarot, meditation, 
            writing down dreams. With that stuff you get lots of dreams! 
            He argued for two years with an elder Jehovah's witness.
        </p>

        <p>
            He'd spent days composing music, sometimes for 15 hours. 
            But not practising his parts for school. Too boring.
            His compositions were just as messy as the rest of his life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any effort to build a life flopped for lack of discipline. 
            Relationships were complicated. Depression hung around the corner. 
            He still remembers the feeling of it. 
            Already since 19 he had been searching for reasons of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            After different failing relationships, he found himself, again alone at 24, 
            living on a boat in the centre of Amsterdam. 
            Again after wrong decisions. 
            Like renting the boat for 3 times his monthly budget. 
            Little choice with his piano, 15 hours a day.          
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it generated stress. Problems with money, smoking, laziness, failures.
            His mental state made him unable to concentrate any longer.
            Any work had become almost impossible. 
            He played piano in Marriott Amsterdam every once in while. For a poor living. 
            They liked him and paid well, but the occasions were little.
            He struggled to stop smoking and get something serious going. 
            He was in a very needy place.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time he was saved by his grandmother. She popped up, 
            out of the blue, in her little Ford Fiesta. 
            Grabbing some clothes, she brought him to her home near The Hague.
            She stopped the rent, got his piano somewhere in a garage
            and cared for him for almost a year. He had stopped his studies. 
            For one year he walked around every night, wondering what to do. 
            At least an hour, often two.
            Then he made up his mind: leave Holland. For good. At 25, a first life ended.
        </p>
        <h4>Second life: France</h4>
        <p>
            His birth country. Maybe he'd find a reason to live there. A second chance?
            <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Living with his father, he tried to be accepted at the National Superior 
            Conservatory in Lyon for a composer's education. 
            Really bad idea. He had worked hard for 6 months. 
            <br><br>
            The director had politely invited him to tell him there was no place for him. 
            Places were already taken. He wondered if the man had even looked at his work. 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            He was happy with his work, though. At least he'd finished something. 
            His work had inspired him. Friends liked it.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with anyone, the relationship with his father was difficult. 
            They were friends, but both strong heads. Unable to live together. 
            He had to go anyway… find his life. 
            He left his father after 6 months and started to travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            His first stop was going to be a religious commune in the 
            South of France. On Corsica, he'd met a friend, Christophe. 
            Christophe had spent four days in the commune and his story was convincing enough 
            to go and find out. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The visit to the commune was shocking. He spent 3 months there, 
            until they told him to leave. 
            He ended up going back a year later and managed to be accepted. 
            He'd made up his mind. He wanted to love and serve God. 
            Something that had never changed ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            He served in the community for 21 years. Working hard, 6 days per week.
            On average 20 hours per day. As a volunteer. 
            That is equivalent to over 60 years of work on a regular job in French society.
        </p>   
        <p>
            They worked, gathered twice a day to make music, dance and sing, share 
            the word of God and pray. On the day of rest, 
            they did activities and played team games.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was zealous in everything. Fast and in the strength of his life. 
            When others did one, he did three. 
            People didn't really like it. Yes, he was a bit extreme. 
            But he had a strong love for his newfound purpose.
            He finally had a reason to give himself wholeheartedly. 
            And have some self-respect. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first 10 years, he was happy and fulfilled. 
            Often sme people don't like it when others are doing well.         
        </p>

        <p>
            If it had been up to him, he would have spent the rest of his days there. 
            He had friends, learned to work hard, many useful skills and the word of God. 
            He got married, raised four children. Not without problems, 
            but still a pretty peaceful life. 
        </p>
        <h3>Vive La France...? </h3>
        <p>
            Things changed. Life got tough. 
            The French government got involved, with severe anti-sect programs.             
        </p>   
        <p>
            6 years earlier, the man and his family had already needed to escape 
            to another country for a year. A judge had tried to place their children 
            in foster homes. 
            It seemed based on negative reports from social workers. 
            They appealed and won their case in court a year later. 
            They could return to France. Until the next trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, offended ex-members had spread lies about the community 
            and lodged complaints. Officials liked it. 
            They prepared their plans for a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night, 3 am, more than 200 police officers invaded the property. 
            Hand-cuffed like criminals, he and his wife, with a few others were 
            placed in custody to be heard for 20 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            An aggressive judicial lady police officer 
            had offered his wife to sign an agreement,
            allowing them to place her children under government control. 
            In exchange for letting her youngest, 18 months old, nurse.
            Luckily she refused. A painful decision.
        </p>    
        <p>
            They were released, at 11 pm that night.
            They found their four children taken away by the authorities. 
            Without any further information as to where, why and for how long.          
        </p>
        <p>
            Only one mother had been concerned. No one had even asked 
            how they were doing. No one had offered help. 
            They were all planning their way out of France, for that same night.
            At midnight, he was pulling the milk from his wife's breast.
        </p>   
        <p>
            A few days later the prosecutor had informed the lawyer where the children were. 
            In a centre for troublesome kids.
            Only his children. No other families were touched. 
            Strange. Why?
        </p>
        <p>
            "Just to make a point for the community." 
            That's what the prosecutor had mentioned to the lawyer 
            in the hallway of the court. Not officially of course.
            "They will be returned in two weeks."
        </p>        
        <p>
            Very little does he imagine the consequences of those two weeks 
            for this little family.
            They would never ever return to their life in the community.
            That's probably what they wanted anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            The man was convinced: his human rights had been severely violated.
            By the French government! 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>"France, land of human rights!" </strong> The rooster 
            sings with his paws in the manure.
            A true believer in the Bible, who wants to obey the word of God, 
            <strong>cannot</strong> live in France and actually obey it!  
            That's a fact. He'll soon end up hand-cuffed, losing his children.
            Or worse. The rooster sings too loud. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And believers have to choose: compromise or leave France. 
            No freedom to live by the Word of God.
        </p>

        <h3>What happened to them after that?</h3>
        <p>        
            For our friend and his family, the price of love had become high. Very high. 
        </p>
        <p>
            They were particularly touched, and his so-called brothers,
            though they'd never said it, wanted them to leave the community.     
        </p>
        <p>
            The consequences were hard to handle. Follow-ups, judges, 
            more social-workers, reports, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the family, stress, attitudes, temptations, doubts. Especially for the children.
            They had been strong and courageous.
            But how could they return and believe like before? 
            In the centre they had discovered how troublesome kids live in the world.
            
            They hadn't missed anything before. 
            They had been happy. Until they knew about life outside.
            It's what he had wanted to avoid. 
            Jerusalem: protection of peace.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for the government, no judgement was ever rendered, no condemnation 
            ever issued. The man and his wife had not even been heard in court.
            Though they had been treated like criminals, 
            they had only been invited to hear a verdict. And they appealed again.
            Officials tried hard to seek fault and justify their actions. 
            They found none.             
        </p>
        <p>
            The family had, over time, 
            won the sympathy of some social workers. 
            Good reports showed up. But judges ignored it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After fighting for 3 years, luckily an objective judge showed up made 
            a better judgement: <br><br>
            <strong>"There is nothing wrong with this family. There is no danger."</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Free. Yes free from courts. For a time. But the damage was done. 
            Community life was impossible. 
            What had been the point of all the pain? What was the gain?
            Their life was destroyed forever.
            Anyone feeling responsible?
            It surely happened to them for a reason.
        </p>
                <p>
            It is deep. It is about God and man, 
            about freedom and conscience, rights and purpose for life.
            It is about family, authority, marriage, fatherhood and relationships. 
            It is about making and keeping covenants 
            and accepting people different from yourself. 
            It is about fear, trust and love, about pride and humility.
        </p>
        <p> 
            There is a lot to say about all these. 
            May the truth be made known in the right time and God be glorified.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            In his family, things had become very difficult. 
            Communication, standards for the children, even beliefs.
            They had never meant to live by themselves, 
            without the help of their friends.
            How was it even possible? They are so different.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Surviving was hard. 
            The community had let them live in a abandoned home, 
            with a van and some stuff to sell.  
            No heating, no money, rats under the bed at night.
            'Thank you and farewell' for 21 years of loyal service.
        </p>
        <p>
            48 years old, three small children, not in school. The oldest one gone. 
            After spending the strength of his youth for others, 
            it was hard to start again from zero.

        </p>
        <p>
            The fellow-believers, the people who had promised 
            care and love, had obviously changed their mind. 
            Those who had proclaimed to love with God's love,
            apparently lacked willingness to suffer long with this family.
            They seemed to have forgotten what it means to baptize and marry 
            people before God. It actually involves a responsibility. 
            Didn't they teach that?
            True love suffers long with faulty people. They taught it, 
            but didn't do it. He now calls them 'The New Pharisees'.
            Do what they say, don't do what they do.
        </p>
        <p>
            God is love, not scriptures. 
            And love is care and action towards the one you love.  
            If a man's 'yes is not yes', he's not worthy to be trusted.
            As for him, the new Pharisees had never been worthy of his heart and loyalty.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Yes, his sense of human dignity and freedom had been hurt.
            By them and by the French government.
        </p>
        <P>
            It had still taken two years before he realized all these and that 
            he wasn't wanted anymore.
            The mental battle had been exhausting. 
        </P>
        <p>
            After four years his wife left him, exhausted by the struggle also.
            She had loved him, but he wasn't able to give her what she needed:
            security.
            Under influence of deceptive counsel, 
            without spiritual food, desires grew and love ended. 
            Who can blame her? Though it hurt him deeply, he certainly 
            couldn't blame her.
            She is the weaker vessel. Even for him, it had become unbearable.
            It made the deceptions all together hurt even more.
        </p>
        <p> 
            For years, he couldn't help cry daily. At least once.           
            The situation seemed unrepairable. 
            A once broken covenant cannot easily be restored. 
            Not with his wife, not with his brothers.
            How can a man trust again, those whom he'd given  his heart, 
            after they crushed it?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So there he was again. Poor and needy. In the pit.
            Where to go? What to do?
            It also took a while to realize the pit is not a bad place to be.
        </p>
            <h3>Third life: wherever it will be.</h3>
        <p> 
            His conclusions?
        </p>
        <p> 
            Concerning religion:<br>
            Religion is not for institutions. Even in the Bible, 
            the ones that taught the word of God, 
            also crucified the son of Man. 
            <br> 
            Please, God, spare me their fate.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Concerning government: <br>
            All authority is instituted by God. The Almighty will judge them. 
            Rather not be in their place.
            It's a believer's job to respect and obey. 
            Even when he thinks they are wrong.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Concerning family: <br> 
            Better forgive. Messiah also was forsaken by his own. 
            It is an honour to suffer a bit like Him! 
            A friend loves at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in the hard and selfish world. 
            Poor and needy, yes, but a bit wiser than before.
            His second life had ended for good, but the third had started.
            He regretted nothing.<br>
        </p>

        <p> 
            His belief? <br>
            Still the same. Go back and start again. Winners don't give up. 
            Only losers do.
        </p>

        <h4>The Dream</h4>

        <p>
            He still has a dream. <br>
            The same as ever. And he writes it down again. A home for the lonely. 
            A place where love and care can be real. 
            A place where people are accepted, however they are. 
            A place to belong.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it means a little pain and trouble. 
            Love hurts. But love is worth it.
            Love suffers long with people and bears all things.
            That's the instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has always been his desire.
            Probably since his parents divorced.
            There is a price to pay for a believer. 
            At least he has to forbear with those he promised love and care.            
        </p>
        <p>
            His third life started at 52 years old. Turn 25 around and you have 52.
            When he arrived in France, he had a dream: he saw numbers: 25 and 52. 
            And he saw the 25 breaking the 52 with two kicks.             
        </p>
        <p>
            Back then he thought the dream was about him and his father, 
            who was 52 at that time, while he was 25. 
            Now he wonders again. 
            At 25 his second life started, and at 52, his third.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Whatever it all means, there are a fresh beginning and a purpose. 
            New chances to do better in the future.
            With hope that he's not alone.
            <br>
            With a piano and a computer. With little faith, 
            a bit freedom and some stories to share.
            And probably like-minded friends somewhere on earth.
        </p>
