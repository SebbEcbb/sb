        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing high school in Holland, needing to make a living,
            I found work as cashier, in what was back then called, the ABN bank. 
            I did well in the job. After a while though, 
            my artistic aspirations 
            urged me, and I felt I would regret not trying to enter the
            School for High Arts in Utrecht, the Netherlands, 
            with piano. And indeed, after a year of preparation, I was accepted in the school.
            I studied there 4 years classical piano music under Alwin Bär.
        </p>
        <p>
            After study, wanting to discover more of 
            my roots and birth country, France, I started to travel. 
            Musical aspirations were dormant for the time. 
            <br><br>
            After a while, I made new friends and worked on a farm.
            Hard work was necessary to live well and be happy.
            We regularly played music together with friends. 
            But only for pleasure.

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Financial manager</h2>
        <p>
            In the company a need arose for a bookkeeper.
            I was drawn to the job. Descending from a governmental accountant, 
            who worked for the Ministry of Finance in Dutch colonies,
            I must have inherited my grandfather's passion for financial numbers.  
            <br><br>
            As co-owner of the business, I volunteered and became financial business manager in the group,
            with 2 interconnected enterprises. 
            One enterprise did construction jobs, 
            the other enterprise produced and imported organic food and healthcare products.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The main responsibility was to keep financial order and produce the legal statements.
            As co-owner, I was also called to engage in other areas, such as marketing, 
            importations, and the organization of national and international fairs.<br>
            The group had over 50 workers and about 1.2 M€ global sales per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first years, I was directly supervised and trained by the professional accountants the business hired. 
            I learned all the necessary bookkeeping procedures. 
            After 3 years, I started to manage these tasks without their supervision. 
            I reported the statements directly to the governmental institutions.
            Several audits have been issued under my responsibility, 
            without significant consequences.
            The books were in order.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my years as financial manager, 
            I developed personalized applications, 
            under Excel & VBA, to automate the bookkeeping tasks.                
            These tools allowed anyone to enter simple transactions. It then
            transformed them into the official bookkeeping journals, that were imported in the software.
            Thus, we gained tremendous amounts of time and increased our working capacity.

        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
            When the company changed policy and direction, 
            after 14 years as co-manager,
            it was time for new experiences. 
            I started a business in commerce, 
            at first selling the products I knew well from the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, COVID19 ruined the markets. 
            In my commerce, it had become impossible to make a decent living for a family with 4 kids.
            So I switched to take on construction & maintenance jobs for people I knew. 
            There was a demand for such service, and I had the experience. 
            My business thus became a multi-task construction and maintenance company,
            still being active today.

        <h2>Web Developer & Content-creator</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, mainly at night, I have invested quite some time 
            in learning web development and building websites. 
            At first, by need for companies, 
            but since, writing has become part of my personality. 
            I discovered an excellent new way to express 
            creative and artistic inspirations.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I became passionate about the technology that makes it possible
            to create pages and communicate content to illimited numbers 
            of people, all around the world. The possibilities are endless,
            and it is only the beginning. I continue to invest time
            into the skills of web development & content creation.
        </p>        
        <p>
            Though time lacks to go fast with this, at least for now, 
            I do advance in my projects. 
            After studying html, css, js, php and python courses, 
            I recently managed to get away from paid platforms, 
            by learning how to use Git and Github.
            Still in a beginning stage, I peacefully work on a few websites 
            and have a few dozen articles to upload.

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Piano & YouTube</h2>
        <p>So what happened to the piano studies and music?</p>
        <p> 
            Well, there is a time for everything. 
            Artistic expression is essential in life, but it has its time and place.
            To live by being a musician or artist in general,
            one has to develop great skills according to the needs of society's demand.
        </p>
        <p> Or else, one has to accept to be an unrecognized artist,
            making a living in a different way. 
            This does not disqualify at all the work of the artist.
            Things simply take time to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally I believe that art must mature. Like fruit.
            No body picks a ripe apple from a recently planted tree.
            The tree must grow and the apple must ripen. 
            And unripe fruit is not pleasant. Artists need lots of patience 
            in order to ripen.
            Their work needs to grow into what they have to offer. It demands sacrifice.
            The process cannot be accelerated. 
            It just takes time & devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            It hd taken me years before I was able to present some acceptable work
            to the public. For many reasons. 
            But now it's rolling. I found my projects and my mission in music.
            At least for now. I won't go here into the artistic aspect of it,
            but I will later, with dedicated articles. 
            Here is a link to one article about 
            <strong><a href="https://sebastienbadel.com/Articles/improvisation-and-flow.html#section-6" target="_blank">
                artists and their work.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I play for artistic expression and not to make a living.
            I share it on YouTube for the same reason. Artistic Expression.
            I do not expect a lot of people to love or follow it. 
            It doesn't matter to me. 
            I value all the more those who do appreciate it, since it proves 
            we have a common sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            What counts for me is the realization of artistic works and their growth.
            Not only in music. Growth must be organic, 
            resulting from focus and perseverance.
            Anything else will not last.
            If I could make a living from music, great, I would be glad. 
            But I will not much compromise my artistic freedom of expression, 
            neither exchange it for commercial profits. 
            Its value to me is beyond material benefits. 
        </p>
