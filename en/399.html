        <h2>Perfect Peace in weakness</h2>

        <p>
            7 years of tears <br>
            To finish with a good thirty <br>
            And the dismantling of a family that was too strong <br>
        </P>
        <P>
            The too strong finally weak <br>
            He certainly wanted it <br>
            And understood it for a long time <br>
            He had named and dedicated <br>
            Many years before <br>
            “Perfect Peace in Weakness”
        </p>

        <p>
            “His power will be perfected therein!” <br>
            Prophetic of course <br>
            He knew his lyrics <br>
            “So be at peace, my son” <br>
            “You know how to do it.” <br>
            But he didn't yet know the pains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Father, husband and brother <br>
            His harshness was to defend <br>
            For lack of protection <br>
            With a too tender heart believing <br>
            Shel didn't know how to do it <br>
            Still doesn't understand today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why did they hate so much? <br>
            To the point of wanting to destroy everything? <br>
            His faith was beyond theirs <br>
            And he was never disappointed <br>
            Their hatred only confirms it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence, light and gentle, <br>
            Luminous for clairvoyants <br>
            Lights up his heart still <br>
            Of freedom and victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where is the power? <br>
            Where are vengeance and justice? <br>
            These belong to him <br>
            So he will wait patiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the bottom of the mud <br>
            Longing for it still <br>
            He rebuilds his strength <br>
            By the magic of faith <br>
            It will be perfect this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            And he will sing again <br>
            Songs never seen before <br>
            Praises to his God <br>
            Multitudes will see <br>
            Trembling, them too <br>
            They will confide.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Hallelu Yah <br>
            Everything will be for him
        </p>
