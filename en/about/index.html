            <p>
                Born in France, near Saint-Etienne, 1971.
                French dad, Dutch mum. <br>
                I grew up in Holland, from age 1.
                Good in math, sports and music. Started piano at 11.
                Mum was determined.
            </p>        

            <p>
                After high school, I entered School for Higher Arts & Music in Utrecht, with piano.
                4 years of studying music showed me music was for expression, 
                but not to make a living. Not for me anyways. <br>
                I left for France. 
                With new friends we started a company on a farm, in organic food production. 
                I learned that musicians need to sweat and work hard, 
                to not lose their mental heath. So I did.

            <h2>Entering into Finance</h2>
            <p>
                The company had bookkeeping needs.
                As descendant of an accountant 
                of the Dutch Ministry of Finance,
                I probably inherited my grandfather's gift with numbers.  
                <br><br>
                So I volunteered and I ended up co-owner and financial manager
                for two enterprises.             
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The mission:</b><br> "Make order in finances 
                and produce the statements."
            </p>
            <p>
                Supervised and trained by accountants for a couple of years,
                I learned the finance & bookkeeping skills.             
                I also started to develop applications.
                With VBA I automated repetitive bookkeeping tasks for myself & users.

            <p>
                After 14 years, company and family needs changed.
                My career as bookkeeper paused and 
                I started my business and took on various jobs :

            <h2>Web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Over the years, I sacrificed many nights to learn to code. 
                By need and for pleasure.                        
                An excellent way for creativity.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Passionate about the technology that makes it possible
                to offer applications, tools & content to unlimited numbers 
                of people all around the world, it's all clear : possibilities are endless! 
            </p>
            <p>In 2025 I started a professional study for web development with Angular & Python business applications.</p>

            <p>What happened to piano ?</p>
            <p> 
                There is a time for everything. After hard work, 
                it is time to relax.
                Artistic expression is essential for life, 
                but it has its own time and place. 
                For me it comes in waves and periods.       
            </p>        
            <p>
                Art must ripen. No body picks a ripe fruit from a recently planted tree.
                A tree must grow and fruit must ripen, to be enjoyable. 
                Any artist needs to grow into what he has to offer. 
                Patience is part of the art. 
                So I continue patiently, not knowing where the ship will strand.

                More on artists and their work.</a></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Art is to express thoughts and feelings. Not to obtain glory.            
                Pure art is not expecting other people to value it. 
                Of course creators are happy when people do.
            </p>
            <p>
                What counts is to do what we deeply believe in. 
                And if we do so, things grow into perfection, little by little. 
                Any strive for personal success and appreciation from society 
                defiles all beauty and makes artwork ugly.<br><br>
                It is a struggle for creators to keep their motives pure. 
            </p>
