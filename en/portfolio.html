        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing high school in Holland, I needed to make a living.
            I found work as cashier, in what was back then called, the ABN bank. 
            I did well in the job. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My artistic aspirations urged me though.  
            I felt I would regret not trying to enter
            School for Higher Arts & Music (Utrecht),
            with piano. After a year of preparation, I was accepted
            and I studied 4 years under Alwin Bär.
        </p>
        <p>
            After studies I concluded that music was for expression
            and not to make a living. I also wanted to discover 
            my roots and birth country. So I started to travel in France.             
            <br><br>
            I made new friends and learned to work hard on a farm.
            We regularly played music together, but only for pleasure.
        </p>

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Finance</h2>
        <p>
            In our company bookkeeping needs arose.
            Drawn to the job, descendant of a government accountant 
            for the Dutch Ministry of Finance,
            I probably inherited my grandfather's gift with numbers.  
            <br><br>
            Co-owner of the business, I volunteered and I ended up financial manager
            for two interconnected enterprises. 
            One did construction jobs, the other organic food and healthcare products.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The main responsibility was to keep financial order and produce the legal statements.
            I also operated in other areas, such as marketing, 
            importation and organization of fairs.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            At first directly supervised and trained by professional accountants,
            I learned the bookkeeping procedures. 
            After 3 years I started to manage the work without supervision.             
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed personalized applications, 
            under Excel & VBA, to automate the bookkeeping tasks.                
            The tools allowed a novice to enter simple transactions and 
            transformed them into official journals, that
            were imported in the bookkeeping software.

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
            When the company changed policy and direction, 
            after 14 years as co-manager,
            it was time for me to get new experiences. 
            After some solar jobs, I started a business in commerce,
            selling the products I knew well from the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, COVID19 ruined my markets. 
            It had become impossible to make a decent living for a family with 4 kids.
            I switched to take on jobs for people and my business became a multi-task 
            construction and maintenance company.

        <h2>Web Developer & Content-creator</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, mainly at night, I have invested mainy hours 
            in learning web development and building websites. 
            By need for companies, and for pleasure.
            I discovered an excellent way for creativity and artistic expression.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Passionate about the technology that makes it possible
            to create applications, serving tools & content to illimited numbers 
            of people, all around the world, I consider the possibilities endless.
            My thirst for learning is only beginning and I will surely continue to invest time
            and effort into the skills of web development.

        <h2>Piano & YouTube</h2>
        <p>So what happened to the piano ?</p>
        <p> 
            There is a time for everything. After hard work, it is time to relax.
            Artistic expression is essential in my life, but it has its time and place.            
        </p>        
        <p>
            I believe art must mature and ripen, just like fruit.
            No body picks a ripe apple from a recently planted tree.
            A tree must grow and the apple must ripen. 
            Unripe fruit is not enjoyable. Art need patience to ripen.
            Artists need to grow into what they have to offer.
            The process is organic and in my opinion cannot be accelerated.             
        </p>
        <p>
            
            
            <strong><a href="https://sebastienbadel.com/en/improvisation-and-flow.html#section-6" target="_blank">
                Here are more thoughts on artists and their work.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I play for artistic expression and not to make a living.
            I share it on YouTube for the same reason. Artistic Expression.
            I do not expect a lot of people to love or follow it. 
            It doesn't matter to me. 
            I value all the more those who do appreciate it, since it proves 
            we have a common sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            What counts for me is to advance in our passions and in
            the creation of artistic works. And their natural growth.
            Not only in music. 
        </p>
