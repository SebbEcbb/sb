        <h2>Financial manager</h2>
        <p>
            As descendant of a Dutch governmental accountant, 
            employed by the Ministry of Finance in the Dutch colonies,
            I certainly inherited my grandfather's passion for financial numbers.  
            <br><br>
            I became co-owner and financial manager in a group of 2 interconnected enterprises. 
            One enterprise did construction jobs, the other enterprise sold organic food and care products, 
            either importing or producing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main responsibility was to keep financial order and produce the legal statements.
            But as co-owner I was also called to engage in other activities, such as marketing, 
            importations, and organizing national and international fairs.<br>
            The group engaged over 50 workers, and produced almost 2M global sales per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first years I was directly supervised and trained by professional accountants. 
            I learned all the necessary bookkeeping procedures. 
            After 3 years, I started to manage these tasks without their supervision. 
            I reported the statements directly to the financial institutions.
            Several governmental audits have been issued after that, 
            but have never had significent corrective consequences for the group.
            The work was ok.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my years as financial manager, I developed personalized applications, 
            under Excel & VBA, to automate the bookkeeping tasks.                
            These tools allowed anyone to enter simple transactions, and transform
            them into official journals which could then be imported in the official book-keeping software.
            Thus we gained tremendous time and increased our working capacity.

        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
            When the company changed policy and direction, 
            after 14 years as manager,
            it was time for new experiences. 
            I started a business in commerce, 
            at first selling the products I knew well from the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, COVID19 ruined the markets. It had become impossible for me 
            to make a decent living with commerce.
            I switched to taking on construction & maintenance jobs for people I knew. 
            There was a demand for such and I had the experience. 
            My business thus became a construction and maintenance company.

        <h2>Web Developer & Content-creator</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, mainly at night, I have invested many hours 
            in learning web development and building websites. 
            First by need for the companies, 
            but ever since, writing has become part of my personality. 
            I discovered an excellent new way to express 
            creative and artistic inspirations.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I became passionate about the technology that makes it possible
            to create pages, able communicate content to illimited numbers 
            of people all around the world. Its possibillities are endless
            and it is only the beginning. So I continue to invest my time
            into this technology.
        </p>        
        <p>
            Though time lacks to go fast in this, at least for now, 
            I faithfully advance in my projects. 
            After some html, css, js, php and python courses, 
            I recently managed to get away from the paying platforms, 
            by learning to use Git and Github.
            Still in beginning stages, I peacefully work on a couple websites 
            and a few dozen articles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is still time to learn more skills,
            before things launching too soon. But here is a example:
