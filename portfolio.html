        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing college in Holland, by need of make a living,
            I started to work as cashier in what was called back then, the ABN bank. 
            I did well in the job. After a while though, 
            my artistic aspirations and potential 
            urged me that I would regret if I would not try to enter the 
            School for High Arts in Utrecht, Netherlands, with piano. 
            And indeed, after a year of preparation, I was accepted in the school.
            I studied 4 years classical piano under Alwin Bär.
        </p>
        <p>
            Needing to discover life, I started to travel after the 4 years,
            mainly to come to know my roots and birth country, France. 
            I met friends and worked on a farm.
            Musical aspirations were dormant for the time. 
            Hard work was necessary to live and be fullfilled.
            Still regularly we played music with friends for pleasure.

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Financial manager</h2>
        <p>
            In the company, a need for a bookkeeper arose.
            I was drawn to it. Descending from a Dutch governmental accountant, 
            who worked for the Ministry of Finance in Dutch colonies,
            I must have inherited my grandfather's passion for financial numbers.  
            <br><br>
            So as co-owner, I volunteered and became financial business manager in the group,
            with 2 interconnected enterprises. 
            One enterprise did construction jobs, 
            the other enterprise produced and imported organic food and healthcare products.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The main responsibility was to keep financial order and produce the legal statements.
            But as co-owner, I was also called to engage in other domains, such as marketing, 
            importations, and the organization of national and international fairs.<br>
            The group employed over 50 people, and had about 2M € of global sales per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first years, I was directly supervised and trained by the professional accountants the business hired. 
            I learned all the necessary bookkeeping procedures. 
            After 3 years, I started to manage these tasks without their supervision. 
            I reported the statements directly to the financial institutions.
            Several governmental audits have been issued after that, 
            without any significant corrective consequences for the group.
            The finances were fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my years as financial manager, I developed personalized applications, 
            under Excel & VBA, to automate the bookkeeping tasks.                
            These tools allowed anyone to enter simple transactions. It then
            transformed it into official bookkeeping journals and were imported in the software.
            Thus, we gained tremendous amounts of time and increased our working capacity.

        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
            When the company changed policy and direction, 
            after 14 years as manager,
            it was time for new experiences. 
            I started a business in commerce, 
            at first selling the products I knew well from the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, COVID19 ruined the markets. 
            In my commerce, it had become impossible to make a decent living for a family with 4 kids.
            So I switched to take on construction & maintenance jobs for people I knew. 
            There was a demand for such service and I had the experience. 
            My business thus became a multi-task construction and maintenance company,
            and still is up to today.

        <h2>Web Developer & Content-creator</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, mainly at night, I have invested quite some time 
            in learning web development and building websites. 
            At first, by need for companies, 
            but since, writing has become part of my personality. 
            I discovered an excellent new way to express 
            creative and artistic inspirations.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I became passionate about the technology that makes it possible
            to create pages and communicate content to illimited numbers 
            of people all around the world. The possibilities are endless
            and it is only the beginning. I continue to invest time
            into this technology.
        </p>        
        <p>
            Though time lacks to go fast with this, at least for now, 
            I faithfully advance in my projects. 
            After some html, css, js, php and python courses, 
            I recently managed to get away from the paying platforms, 
            by learning how to use Git and Github.
            Still in a beginning stage, I peacefully work on a few websites 
            and articles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is still time to learn skills and possibilities, and create more content.
            But to give an idea, here is one of my websites:

        <div class="s50"></div>
        <h2>Piano and YouTube</h2>
        <p>So what happened to the piano studies and music?</p>
        <p>
            Well, there is a time for everything. 
            Artistic expression is essential in life, but it has its time and place.
            To live by being a musician or artist in general,
            one has to develop great skills according to the needs of society's demand.
        </p>
        <p> Or else, one has to accept to be an unrecognized artist,
            making a living in a different way. 
            This does not disqualify at all the work of the artist.
            Things simply take time to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally I believe that art must mature. Like fruit.
            No body picks a ripe apple from a recently planted tree.
            The tree must grow and the apple must ripen. 
            And unripe fruit is not pleasant. Artists need lots of patience 
            in order to ripen.
            Their work needs to grow into what they have to offer. It demands sacrifice.
            The process cannot be accelerated. 
            It just takes time & devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took me years before I was able to present some acceptable work
            to the public. For many reasons. 
            But now it's rolling. I found my projects and my mission in music.
            At least for now. I won't go here into the artistic aspect of it,
            but I will later, with dedicated articles. 
            Here is a link to one article about 
            <strong><a href="https://sebastienbadel.com/Articles/improvisation-and-flow.html#section-6" target="_blank">
                artists and their work.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I play for artistic expression and not to make a living.
            I share it on YouTube for the same reason. Artistic Expression.
            I do not expect a lot of people to love or follow it. 
            It doesn't matter to me. 
            I value all the more those who do appreciate it, since it proves 
            we have a common sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            What counts for me is the realization of artistic works and their growth.
            Not only in music. For growth I do not work. 
            To me, growth must be organic. Anything else is not lasting.
            If at some point I could earn income as musician, 
            I might be interested. But I will not compromise my artistic freedom 
            of expression, neither exchange my work for commercial profits. 
            It would be like selling part of my soul.
        </p>
